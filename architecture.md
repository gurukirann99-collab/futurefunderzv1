# 01. Vision & Identity
What FutureFunderz IS

- A lifecycle orchestration platform
- Guides humans from confusion → income → business → growth → exit

- Not a CA / CS / Advocate marketplace
- Not a social network

Core Design Principles

1. One active goal at a time
2. Users buy outcomes, not people
3. Platform assigns and guarantees execution
4. Capital access is gated by readiness
5. No open marketplaces that destroy trust
